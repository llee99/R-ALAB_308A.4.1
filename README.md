# R-ALAB_308A.4.1

This is my project working with external data (API's) 

All deliverables have been met with 2 exceptions:

1) The favourites function does not work as intended. I am not able to configure the favourites method to recognize when an image has been favourited. As a result, when the favourites button is clicked, the method getFavourites() returns an empty collection.
2) The side button arrows to go forward and backwards in viewing images of each individual breed does not function. I believe this is due to the lack of a onClick event listener for the buttons "carousel-control-prev" as well as "carousel-controlnext".

I am looking forward to resolving both issues asap.
